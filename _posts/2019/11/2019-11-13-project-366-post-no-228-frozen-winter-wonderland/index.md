What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).  

When I started this project - 228 days ago on March 29 - the world was in a deep freeze and the creek was encased in thick ice. Ice thick enough to walk, bike and ski on. Well, the creek is frozen again. The ice is still thin and transparent, but with the current temperatures it will not be long before we can yet again go for a nature walk on the creek (rather than by the creek). I am looking forward to this as if offers a refreshing new perspective on a familiar scene. An added bonus is that it also allows to access areas that are inaccessible during the rest of the year. Say what you want about blistering cold temperatures and long dark winters, a nature walk on a early winter morning is an experience that involves all the sense. From the feeling of walking though untouched snow, to the sounds - the muffled silence (the snow absorbs sound) interrupted only by the sounds of steps through snow, the cold on your face, the taste of frozen snots in your mouth (if you have facial hair, you'll understand) is an unique and unforgettable experience bringing you closer to nature. Vive l'hiver!
