What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

A ghillie suit a type of camouflage clothing designed to resemble the background environment such as foliage, snow or sand enabling the wearer to “disappear” into the background. Whoever build this nest achieved the same effect as a ghillie suit. The untidy straws of grass protesting around the best almost eliminates the outline of the best making it blend in with the surroundings. Some people might say that the best is messy. I like to think that the design of the nest was intentional and a highly effective camouflage trick.
