What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).  

The snow cover at the Whitemud Ravine is criss-crossed by the distinct tracks of rabbits and hares. Here in Alberta we have three species of native rabbits and hares, the cottontail rabbit, snowshoe hare and white-tailed jackrabbit. While I cannot tell the species apart just based on their tracks they are relatively easy to identify if you spot one.
