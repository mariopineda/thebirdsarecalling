What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).  

The two weeks have been an ongoing thaw-freeze cycle with thawing during the day and freezing at night. As a result large parts of the creek are ice free or with just thin sheets of ice covering the parts where the water flows slowly. The trails are icy and, without the proper footwear, dangerously slippery. The mild weather has, however, made the birds more active. This is quite typical weather here in central Alberta and it is just a matter of time before we are plunged back into an arctic deep freeze.
