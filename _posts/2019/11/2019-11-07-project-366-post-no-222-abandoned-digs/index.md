With the leaves gone, the branches are exposed revealing nests that were occupied just a few months ago. Meticulously constructed using twigs, grass and lined with feathers these were the domiciles where baby birds were hatched, reared and before moving out and moving on in life. Of course, when the nests were inhabited they were well-concealed by foliage. Will the same inhabitants return next year? Will new tenants move in? Are these disposable nests used only one season? What shape will the nest be after the winter?
