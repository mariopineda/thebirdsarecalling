Sometimes you come across odd, unexpected and out of place things in the forest. Like for example a fir tree with holiday decorations in the middle of the forest. Whoever put up the decorations, did they do it for others to find it and be confused? It is certainly an odd thing to do. Is the person coming back after the holidays to remove the decorations? Only time will tell.
