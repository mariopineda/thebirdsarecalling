Throughout the city parks and forests one encounters locations that are undergoing reforestation. Typically these are locations that were invasive species have been removed followed by an attempt to reintroduce native species. I say “attempt” because most invasive species are very aggressive and once established they can me almost impossible to eliminate. Today’s picture was taken at the Grey Nun’s Spruce Woodlot where baby spruce trees have been planted wrapped in metal mesh to protect them from hungry deer and rabbits.
