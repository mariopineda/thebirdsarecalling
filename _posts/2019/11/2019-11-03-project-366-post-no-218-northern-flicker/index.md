What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

I came across a Northern Flicker today sitting on a trunk working on its nest. Earlier during the summer I saw a flicker at the same cavity, so I assume it could be the same individual. There are two quite different-looking forms of the species, the Yellow-shafted Flicker in the east and north, and Red-shafted Flicker in the west. This particular individual had the red crescent on its nape distinct of the Yellow-shafted Northern Flicker. The dark "mustache stripe" by the beak indicates that it is a male.
