What is Project 366? Read more [her](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)e.  

So winter is definitely here. The snow arrived over the weekend and the temperature has dropped drastically. This morning as we were heading to the Whitemud Creek the mercury was at -24C. It was a beautiful clear morning, the sun was beaming from a clear blue sky and, yes it was cold but the absence of a breeze made it tolerable. Of course, all the winter her was required; long johns, layer upon layer on the upper body, heavy duty kits, double toques and [Little Hotties](http://Little Hotties Hand Warmers 40 Pairs https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001G6SQMG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_SAIYDb0DWG3K4) stuffed into the boots. Other then the Black-capped Chickadees and cawing of ravens on the distance we did not see much of the fauna. It was nevertheless a beautiful walk and the fresh snow and frozen creek turned a familiar landscape into something magical.
