What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).  

In a naked tree right by the Whitemud Creek, along a sinuous bend in the creek, an abandoned bird's nest is clinging perilously to a branch that seems to be far to narrow for it to balance on it. It must have been a prime real estate location during the summer, with a view of the creek and beavers frolicking in the waters below. One can still see lichen that was used for insulation and warmth sticking out of the nest. The nest is now covered in snow and I have my doubts whether it will survive the winter storms and the weight of heavy snow.
