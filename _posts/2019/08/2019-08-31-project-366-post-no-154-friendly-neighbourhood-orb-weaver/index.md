The orb weavers are one of the more magnificent arachnids in these neck of the woods and this time of the year we have plenty of them looking for a quick meal in our back yard. There are more than a dozen different species of orb weavers in Alberta and they are often found in back yards along the sides of houses and garages. They like to build their webs hear light sources that are left on overnight. If you are a spider tending to a web hoping for some juicy insects to get entangled building your web near a nocturnal light source makes of course a lot of sense. We all know how lights at night attract insects so clearly and clearly the orb weavers have figured this out as well. I came across this plump female, because it is likely to be a female as they are the ones that get the largest this time of year, in a nook by the front light of my house. She had quite a few tangled up flies and mosquitos in her web so it looks like she is doing quite well.
