Last time I was down at the Whitemud Ravine at dawn it was a clear morning with not a single cloud in the sky. As the sun was rising over the eastern horizon a waning crescent moon was setting in the west. I am not much for moon shots but lots of people use their Nikon P1000 to photograph the moon. I suspect mainly to demonstrate the capabilities of the camera. The P1000 has lots of limitations but taking close up pictures of the moon is not one of them. This is entirely thanks to the behemoth sized zooming capabilities of the camera. At 3000 mm at 35 mm equivalent fully zoomed in the camera is more of a telescope than anything thing else. I rarely use it beyond about 1000 mm as the image quality deteriorates noticeably at longer focal lengths. I have never actually thought of shooting the moon with this camera, but with the moon right up there and with the camera in hand I figure “why not?”. I did not, however, zoom in on the moon as I wean Ted to get some foreground into the image as well. So here it is, my first moon shot with the P1000. Only time will tell if this is the first of others to come.
