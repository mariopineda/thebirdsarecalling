Is this thing on? Check, one, two, check, check...

Welcome to _The Birds are Calling_. You can think of this blog as a digital and cloud-based naturalist field journal covering a broad range of topics related to natural history. The title, _The Birds are Calling_, is a play on the famous John Muir quote _The mountains are calling and I must go_. Why are the birds calling (and not the mountains)? Well, for one, most birds are quite capable of calling while mountains, as majestic as they may be, remain silent. Of course, John Muir did not actually try to claim that the mountains are calling in a literal sense. Rather he was referring to a perceived need to head out into the mountains, not a trifling need,... fleeting, as in say a passing fancy. No, a resolute and unyielding need and yearning. As much as I enjoy the mountains, birds are special. When you are looking for birds, you tend to see everything else that is out there along the way, things that you otherwise might miss. If you are looking for mountains, on the other hand, you'll probably find them (they tend to be quite conspicuous after all), but you may miss the small details along the way..., like the songbirds in the forest on your way up the mountain or the eagles soaring high above the mountain.

I don't know yet how this "field journal" will unfold, but this is a start and now I just have to figure it out along the way, or as someone once said, I am flying this air plane while I am building it.

_May the curiosity be with you. This is from "The Birds are Calling" blog (www.thebirdsarecalling)._
