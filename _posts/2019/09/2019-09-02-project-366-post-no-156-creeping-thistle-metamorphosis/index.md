What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

The Creeping Thistle inflorescences, which are everywhere along forest edges and open fields, are slowly undergoing a metamorphosis from pretty fuzzy purple flowers to mangy-looking fuzzy grey bunches of seed. The seeds have a feathery appendage, aka as a pappus, that enable the seed to be carried by the wind. Wind dispersed seeds is, however, only one trick the Creeping Thistle has up its sleeve when it comes to reproducing. It is also able to make new copies of itself by reproducing vegetatively by developing an extensive lateral root system.
