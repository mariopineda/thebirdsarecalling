What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

A solitary female mallard was perched on an underwater rock energetically grooming her flight feathers. Perhaps she was getting ready to embark on her journey south. Her speckled fuzzy feathers blended in perfectly with the wilting yellow-brown reeds. It was a cold and crisp morning at the Heritage Wetlands Park. As most birds already have flown south I did not expect to see much. It turnes out that this location is full of surprises. These unassuming wetlands treated me to my first Belted Kingfisher and a Merlin last week. This time both the kingfisher and Merlin were nowhere to be found but instead I ended up seeing (or hearing) 13 species during the hour I was strolling around the ponds. The last time I spotted more species in a single outing was in mid-May and that walk lasted for two and a half hours, so I would say that today was pretty successful. The final breakdown of today’s tally is:

> 10 Canada Goose  
> 10 Mallard  
> 1 Bufflehead  
> 10 Common Goldeneye  
> 2 Hooded Merganser  
> 4 Red-necked Grebe  
> 2 Ring-billed Gull  
> 1 Pileated Woodpecker  
> 1 Black-billed Magpie  
> 1 American Crow  
> 1 Black-capped Chickadee  
> 5 American Robin  
> 2 Song Sparrow

On a different note. This is post 183 which means it is the half-way mark of Project 366. 183 posts down, 183 posts to go and still going strong.
