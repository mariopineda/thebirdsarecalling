What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

The seeds of the Creeping Thistle are about to get airborne. All it will take now is the slightest of wind puffs and they are on their way. This inflorescence almost looks like it has a bad hair day. But it will not last. Soon the seeds will be gone with the wind. Each Creeping Thistle plant can produce thousands of seeds at the end of the summer. In addition to reproducing using wind-dispersed seeds, the Creeping Thistle also reproduced vegetatively by creeping roots (rhizomes). These two reproductive methods result in the plant being a formidable weed that, once established, is virtually impossible to eliminate. It often invades crop fields and grasslands where it lowers crop yields and forage productivity.
