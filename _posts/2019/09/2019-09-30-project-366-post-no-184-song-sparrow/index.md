What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

A Song Sparrow hiding among the reed was letting everyone know it was there. Song Sparrows can be found in our city parks until the end of October at which point most of them head south to continental USA. Occasionally, however, the odd one decides to stay behind braving the local winter. True to its name, the Song Sparrow has a colorful repertoire of songs. In one of his journals Henry David Thoreau suggested that the song sounded to him like "Maids! Maids! Maids! Hang up your teakettle-ettle-ettle." Song sparrows tend to develop local dialects and some people even claim that no two Song Sparrows have the same song. There is a collection of recorded songs [here](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Song_Sparrow/sounds) to give you a taste of the diversity of songs. The typical "three short identical notes followed by a longer one" has even [been compared to](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/life/2015/07/01/nature-journal-neglect-wnc-song-sparrow/29557309/) rhythmical pattern of the beginning of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. I am not entirely convinced about the Beethoven's Fifth comparison but I will keep my ears peeled next time I am listening to a Song Sparrow.
