What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

The fall colors are now coming in with full force. Officially the first day of fall in the Northern Hemisphere is on Monday September 23, in three days. So the timing of the changing colors of the leaves is pretty good. Last year we were hit with the first snow on the last day of summer. There is currently no snow in the forecast, but things are definitely cooling so anything is possible I assume. The bird diversity has decline noticeably. The ponds and lakes are eerily empty and one can start feeling the fall in the air. It is a bit melancholic that what once was is not gone and we are standing at the door step of a long dark and cold winter. On a more cheerful note, winter will bring with it new denizens of the frozen wilds. The snowy owls, the Bohemian Waxwings, Redpolls, and Pine Siskins.
