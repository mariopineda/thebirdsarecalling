What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

Reports came in today from the National Weather Service in Duluth (Minnesota) of weather radars that were lit up with what appeared to be storm systems moving in. It turned out that it was not a storm at all, just [an estimated 900000 ducks](https://twitter.com/NWSduluth/status/1187486476386177024) on their way to who know where? Perhaps they were on their way to their overwintering grounds en masse. Today's picture was taken a few days ago, so while the moon was in its Third Quarter then, today it is Waning Crescent. All these clear days with early morning moons and birds migrating make you wonder if birds use the moon to either time migrations and/or for navigation. It has been know for a long time that birds use specific start constellation during, such as the Polaris star, as well as the sun to navigate during their migrations. I have not been able to find any information about the role of the moon in bird migrations. Yes, today's picture is almost identical to the picture in [Post 208](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/10/23/project-366-post-no-208-maple-in-repose/)..., except that that the focus differs..., so, very similar, yet different focal points.
