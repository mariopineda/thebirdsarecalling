What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

I assume it was bound to happen. Just like the Terminator said "I will be back", so did the beavers. It appears that over the last month or so an army of beavers have invaded the Whitemud Creek. They have left their telltale signs all along the creek, with downed trees, chewed branches and debarked trunks. It is quite obvious that they mean business. Even trunks that have been covered in metal wire mesh - a way to deter beavers from damaging high valued trees - have not been spared. I am not entirely sure how they get to the trunk if there is a metal mesh in the way, but I guess if you are an uber-ambitious beaver you could either try to go under or over the mesh with a bit of acrobatic maneuvering..., or through the mesh if you are patient. Expect more beaver action picture over the next few days. I have not yet actually spotted a beaver, but I imagine that it only a matter of time.
