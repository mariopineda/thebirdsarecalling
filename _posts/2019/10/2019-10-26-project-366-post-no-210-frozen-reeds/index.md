The shores of the Heritage Wetland Park in Sherwood Park are covered in dense reeds, making access to the lakes difficult. There are a few locations, however, where it appears that the reeds have been removed on purpose. Perhaps these are access locations for boats, although I have never seen any boats on the lakes and, other than for a kayak or canoe, the lakes (more like ponds) are likely too small for any more substantial vessels. In this picture one can see a thin layer of morning ice between the reeds. The ice did not last long as the sun warmed up the day the ice disintegrated.
