What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/)!

There is a rather unique tree down in the Whitemud Ravine. It is large and tall and half way up its trunk there is a l large cavity that has been used as a nesting cavity by Great Horned Owls for a number of years, most recently last spring. The other day I noticed that the base of the trunk had been wrapped in wired mesh. With the beavers coming back with a vengeance over the last few weeks it is hardly surprising that the city has tried to protect the tree. The City of Edmonton's official policy on reducing beaver damage is to protect "high value trees" using metal mesh around the base of the trunk. As this is the only know Great Horned Owl nest it this part of the ravine this is definitely a high-value tree ([see post 32](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/04/29/project-366-post-no-032-great-horned-owl-family/)). At this time of the year, the owls are nowhere to be see. One can only hope that the will be back next spring with a new batch of adorable owlets.
