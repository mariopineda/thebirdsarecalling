The winged fruits of a maple tree are unmistakable. Maple belongs to the Acer family and although it is commonly viewed as an iconic Canadian species (just look at our flag or maple syrup) the majority (about two thirds) of the 128 maple species are found in Asia. In Canada, ten species of maple can be found growing natively, perhaps the most famous one being the sugar maple, which is the species occurring on the Canadian flag and used for maple syrup. The botanical name for the helicopter seeds is samara.
