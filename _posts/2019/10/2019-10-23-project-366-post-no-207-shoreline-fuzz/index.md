After experiencing the a winter and summer season watching birds, plants and other critters it is clear that there are some rather unique pros and cons to both seasons. The obvious pro of the spring and summer was the explosion in the diversity of birds..., but it comes at a price. Foliage! During the summer, many times I could hear the birds but due to foliage and vegetation I was never able to actually see them. The leaves are gone now and so are most of the birds, but whoever is left is much easier to spot. On the other hand, it is much harder to identify plants now that all the leaves are gone. So here is one enigmatic plant growing along the shores of Heritage Wetland park in Sherwood park. I suspect that if it would have had leaves left it would be straightforward to identify, but without the foliage..., not so much. Lets just call it shoreline fuzz. I like the back-light making the spherical balls of seeds look all fuzzy. Looks like the fuzz balls are here to stay for the next little while. Long live the fuzz balls.
