House Sparrows are usually not considered particularly glamorous as far as birds go, perhaps because they are so common. Native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and a large part of Asia it has been introduced - on purpose or accidentally - in most parts of the world. These days it is easily the most common wild bird across the world. On this chilly morning we came across a dozen House Sparrows skulking in the shrubbery. They caught my attention because they seemed plumper than usual. Maybe they were just well fed or maybe they had fluffed up their feathers for added insulation.
