Encountered the first butterfly of the year down at the Whitemud Ravine yesterday. Actually, I saw quite few of these little guys. These are Compton tortoiseshell butterflies (_Nymphalis vaualbum_) and is usually one of the earliest butterflies to be seen in the spring. This species is circumpolar around the Northern Hemisphere and, hence, is found across Canada south of the tundra. Nature is slowly waking up after a long winter but this far north everything is happening much later compared to locations further south south. We still have to see any signs of greenery. Any day now I hope. Things are likely to pickup speed during the last two weeks of April.
