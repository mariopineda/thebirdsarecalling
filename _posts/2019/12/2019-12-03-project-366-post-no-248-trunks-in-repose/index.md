It is difficult to tell if these trunks belong to a living or a dead tree. Green leaves are like a pulse of a living being..., an assurance that the life processes are still going on. Without leaves, however, the difference between the dead and living is harder to pinpoint. One could probable make an argument that any deciduous perennial plant would be in a state of suspended life during the winter. It begs the question are there any cellular processes going on in a tree like the one in today's photo during the deep cold winter?
