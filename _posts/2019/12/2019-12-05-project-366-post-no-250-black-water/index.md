What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

The temperatures are going up and down and the creek cannot make up its mind if it should stay frozen or not. Most of the Whitemud Creek is now frozen over except for a few spots, mainly under bridges, that are still teetering on the cusp between freezing over completely and staying open. I like this picture, where the crystalline white snow is gradually replaced by paper thin transparent ice where the blackness of the water shines through. The water itself is flowing. Cold and black, disappearing under the ice.
