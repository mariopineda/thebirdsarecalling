What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

A stubble field is a type of agricultural crop residue consisting of the cut stems after the crop has been harvested. Usually the stems are ploughed directly in to the ground in springtime. Stubble fields serve many functions, including nutrients recycling as the stems compost and fertilize the field as well as providing erosion control due to wind and water. Wildlife also benefit from stubble fields as the fields provide shelter and food to various animals, including birds.
