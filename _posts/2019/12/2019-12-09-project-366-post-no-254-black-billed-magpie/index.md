I had returned home from my nature walk and was unpacking the car when I spotted a Black-billed Magpie perched on top of a tall fir tree. Against the blue cloudless sky the bird was impossible to miss. There it was without a worry in the world just keeping an eye on its surrounding. It is easy to dismiss magpies as they are one of those urbanized birds that like to hang out around people. This is my first picture of a magpie, not because I have not seen them, but because I just have not been paying much attention to them.
