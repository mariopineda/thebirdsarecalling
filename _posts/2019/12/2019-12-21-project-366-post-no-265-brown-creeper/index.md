As I was focusing on trying to get a good photo of the Black-backed Woodpecker - after all it was a lifer for me - all of a sudden something else appeared in the view finder. Something grey/brown scurried across the trunk. I knew immediately what it was. It was a Brown Creeper, an small, cryptic and elusive bird. I have seen it twice before but never even tried to take a picture of it. It just seems to small, hard to spot and fast moving to even try to photograph. The Nikon P1000 is rather sluggish and it seems like a long shot trying to photograph this bird. This time, this Brown Creeper literally photo bombed my picture of the Black-backed Woodpecker, so I too the opportunity to snap a few pictures of it. It all happened fast, before I knew it, it was gone. I had managed to snap a handful of pictures of it, none very good. It's a first and any future photos of it can only get better I guess.
