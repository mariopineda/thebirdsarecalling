So finally I was able to take a walk on the creek. The temperature has been consistently well below the freezing point for over a month now and the Whitemud Creek is covered by a thick layer of ice. Well-traveled trails on the ice provided enough reassurance that it would be safe now to walk on the ice. Going for a walk on the creek is a different experience. First of all, since it is flat it is an easy way of travelling through the forest. No ups and downs and as a result the risk of tripping or slipping is virtually eliminated, which is a bit of an oxymoron as you are walking on ice. The trick is obviously that the ice is snow covered so one does have quite a bit of traction. Secondly, the view of the ravine is quite different from the creek than from the trails above the creek and one is able to access parts of the ravine that are difficult to access by land.
