According to eBird reports Evening Grosbeaks had been spotted in Centennial Park in Sherwood Park foraging on Manitoba Maple seeds. Since I was in the neighbourhood I decided to stop by to see if I could spot them. It was a bone chilling morning. I sure found the maples, they were everywhere full of seeds. Unfortunately the Evening Grosbeaks where nowhere to be seen. Better luck next tine.
