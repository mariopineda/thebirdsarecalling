You could hear them all around. Chattering and singing. Like a rambunctious social gathering. Like a large group of old friends all talking at the same time around the dinner table. First we could only hear them, but once our eyes managed to see beyond the tangled branches we could see them, the Bohemian Waxwings. They were everywhere and once we started observing the gaggle we soon realized what all the commotion was about. It was dinner time and the trees were full of fruit. With all the chattering it made you wonder if, by any chance, some of those berries may have something stronger in them just virgin fruit juices. A gaggle of drunken waxwings? Fancy that.
