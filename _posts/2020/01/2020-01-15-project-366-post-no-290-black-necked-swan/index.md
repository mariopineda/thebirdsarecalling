As the temperatures continue to be bitterly cold (sitting at a crispy -31 °C as we speak) one can only dream of past warmer birding outings. About a year ago I was road tripping along dusty country roads in Chile and came across a Black-necked Swan bobbing on a salt water lake in [Boca Budi](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/38%C2%B056'02.4%22S+73%C2%B015'17.3%22W/@-38.9339958,-73.3948757,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d-38.934!4d-73.2548). The Black-necked Swan is unmistakable and is just what the name says: a swan with a black neck. Although it is the smallest member in its genus it is the largest waterfowl native to South America.
