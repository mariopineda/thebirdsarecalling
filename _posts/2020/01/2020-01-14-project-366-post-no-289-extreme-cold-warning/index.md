The bitter cold continues with the temperature reaching -39 °C tonight. Any form out outing, nature walk or birding is out of the question. The forecast is predicting similar temperatures for the rest of the week so there will not be much in terms of new pictures until the temperatures ease up (currently predicted to occur on Sunday). As the situation is now, I'll be lucky if the car starts tomorrow morning. As I am writing this the temperature hit -40 °C.
