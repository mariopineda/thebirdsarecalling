Until recently the winter has been mild by Alberta standards, dipping down to -15 ºC at the lowest. That has all changed now. Today the temperature was hovering around -20 ºC, and right now, at 9 pm it has dropped down to -24 ºC. Overnight temperatures are forecast to drop all the way down to -36 ºC. It is a quite typical for the winter temperatures to drop quite substantially in January and February. Only time will tell if we will reach the magnitude of last year's cold snap, both in terms of how low the temperature goes and for how long (see the post [Owling in the Frozen Wilds](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/02/18/owling-in-the-frozen-wilds/) for a write up of last years record cold snap).
