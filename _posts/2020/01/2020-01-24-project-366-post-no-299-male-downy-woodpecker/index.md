What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

Yesterday's post featured a [female Downy Woodpecker](http://thebirdsarecalling.com/2020/01/22/project-366-post-no-298-black-white-and-red/). Today's post is featuring a male Downy Woodpecker. If it would not be for the red patch on the neck of the male they would be indistinguishable. This male was just a few meters above the feeder where the female was feeding.
