What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

In the northern part of Edmonton, in an industrial area along a major highway there is a large grain terminal. Pigeons flock to the site as the spilled grain is an easy source of food, particularly in the winter. On any given day there are thousands of pigeons roosting on the beams and ducting of the large terminal building. As a result of the abundant food source (not the grain, but the pigeons) the site attracts birds of prey, such as gyrfalcon and bald eagles. I have been wanting to visit the grain terminal for a long time but it was not until this week that I managed to make it. It was a sunny and mild day and sure enough the pigeons were there. I spend most of my lunch hour carefully scanning the pigeons and the duct work on the grain terminal in the hopes of spotting a raptor, it with no luck. The only action I saw were kanoodling pigeons.
