What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

We have now had Extreme Cold Warnings for all of Alberta issued daily for almost a week..., and counting. An extreme cold warning is issued by Environment Canada to inform the public about cold temperatures in their region that are expected to last for at least two hours. An extreme cold warning is issued based on either the temperature or the wind chill being a certain value for at least two hours. The values range from −30 °C in the south to −55 °C in parts of the Arctic. In Alberta an extreme cold warning issued when the temperature or wind chill is expected to reach -40°C for at least two hours.
