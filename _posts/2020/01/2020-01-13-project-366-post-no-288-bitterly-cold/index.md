You know it is cold when the local ski hills shuts down due to the bitter cold and the weather forecasts start to refer to the temperature as "bitterly cold". The thermometer on my backyard deck reads about -25 °C, once you factor in the breeze the windchill drops the temperature down to -37 °C. At these temperatures exposed skin can get frostbites in less than 10 minutes. Yesterday I did try to got for a nature walk at the Grey Nuns White Spruce Park in St. Alberta. I lasted for about 30 minutes before I had to call it a day, and that was about 5 °C warmer than today. While I was hoping for milder temperatures today, once I checked the temperature this morning I knew that heading out for a walk and birding was out of the question. So today's picture will be of my thermometer this morning.

Backyard temperature in the morning..., without the windchill.
