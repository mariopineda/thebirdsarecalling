Officially it is still three weeks to the first day of spring on March 17. This being central Alberta, however, it is quite common that spring is not in the air until substantially later. This year, however, the second half of February has been very springlike, with mild temperatures, sunny skies and lots of snow melt. While there there are now guarantees, one can only hope that they long cold winter season is coming to an end. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of spring is to see all the familiar birds return from their southern overwintering grounds.
