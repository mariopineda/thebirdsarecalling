What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

There often seems to be a trade off between success in finding animals to photograph and the ease of photography. If you want to take pictures of animals, including birds, early morning is better, but at the expense of light. If you want lots of bright light (which makes photography easier), then you are limited to mid day or early afternoon, but this comes at the expense of seeing birds and other animals. Today was a good example of this tradeoff. It was a sunny and beautiful winter's day with springlike conditions. I went for a walk along the North Saskatchewan River by Fort Edmonton. The light was perfect for taking pictures, sunny and clear..., but there were not birds to be seen. One could hear the odd chickadee or nuthatch, but I had no luck in actually spotting any birds or even squirrels. So what does one do? Well, you turn your attention to the less mobile denizens of the forest. like the colorful lichens.
