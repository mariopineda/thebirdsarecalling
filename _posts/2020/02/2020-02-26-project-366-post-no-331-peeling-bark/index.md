What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

Trees trunks and branches grow thicker by adding new cells beneath the bark. The effects of this process can be observed when you are looking at tree rings. To accommodate increased girth the bark also has to increase in width and in doing so the outside parts of the bark crack and sometimes peel off. The picture shows a close up of a pine tree where the bark resembles circular ice floes as it cracking. Eventually the the old dead bark falls off as new bark is emerging beneath it.
