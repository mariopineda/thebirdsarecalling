The river valley is a window into Edmonton's geological the past. The North Saskatchewan River originates 1,800 metres above sea level in the Columbia Icefield. It flows across Alberta and Saskatchewan to Lake Winnipeg, into the Nelson River and eventually into the Hudson Bay. In Edmonton It runs from the southwest to the northeast through the city and is fed by numerous creeks throughout the city, such as Mill Creek and Whitemud Creek. This creates numerous ravines, many of which have been incorporated into the urban parkland. Along sections of the river bank one can see the relentless erosion caused by the fast flowing river. If one knows about geology, I can imagine that the cross sections of the river bank must be alike an open book telling the geological story of the past.
