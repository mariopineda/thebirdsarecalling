The holiday season is long gone and so is winter solstice. With a busy life it is easy to miss that the days are actually getting longer by almost 4 minutes a day. The turnaround point (aka winter solstice) was on December 23 when the day was the shortest at 7 hours 27 minutes and 43 seconds. Today the day was 7 hours 37 minutes 11 seconds long, about 1 hours and 10 minutes longer than on December 23. Of course this all has to do with the motion of Earth around the sun. Today's photograph depicts some long forgotten ornaments still decorating a tree in Hermitage park. The ornaments could be a celestial metaphor for the current season with the large ball representing Earth with a snow and ice covered Northern Hemisphere and the small ball representing the moon.
