What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

As one wanders through through the Grey Nuns Spruce Woodlot you come across a large number of spruce seedlings with protective mesh around them. Apparently around 2500 seedlings were planted in 2019 and a total of over 11,600 spruce trees have been planted since 2016 in an attempt to return the area to its native spruce forest, particularly on locations that were dominated by invasive species. The Grey Nuns White Spruce Forest is an ecologically and historically significant area located at the outskirts of St. Albert and has been designated a Municipal Historic Resource. It is the home of many trees that are well over 100 years old, and a habitat for a variety of birds, mammals, plants, and amphibians.
