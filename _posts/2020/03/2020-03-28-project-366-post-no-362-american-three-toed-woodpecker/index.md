In a clearing at the Grey Nuns Spruce Woodlot a lone American Three-toed Woodpecker was busy working away looking for a meal on a spruce tree trunk. It is only the second American Tree-toed Woodpecker I have seen, the first one was last winter at the Whitemud Ravine. No wonder this one threw me for a bit of a loop. With too much black in its back to be a Downy Woodpecker and too little black on its back to be a Black-backed Woodpecker it had me scratching my head for a minute. This one had a black back with messy white barring and white spots in the wings. The underparts were white with fine blackish barring on the flanks. The face was black with a white line behind the eye and a thin white line below the cheek. The characteristic yellow head patch that males have was missing suggesting that this was a female.
