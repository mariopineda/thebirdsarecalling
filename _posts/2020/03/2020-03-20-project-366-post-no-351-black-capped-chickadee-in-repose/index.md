It is not often one is catches a chickadee just chilling. They always seem to be on the move, never stopping, never resting and never perching long enough for you to aim your camera, focus and get a good picture. Today it was my lucky day though as I encountered this fluffy little fellow just chilling on a branch. Maybe it had had its fill of sunflower seeds and then found this sunny spot where it just contently perched and watched the world go by.
