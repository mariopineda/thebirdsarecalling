Yesterday’s post features a carefree Red Squirrel in a snow blizzard. Today’s post is featuring the Whitemud Ravine Great Horned mom owl in her tree cavity sitting out the blizzard. Getting this picture proved to be a bit of a challenge as the camera’s focusing system was being thrown off by the falling snow. We visited mom and pops owl last week, and this weekend they are still there. Mom still in her cavity and pops on guard in a nearby tree. I am not sure if the female is sitting on the eggs yet. If not it would just be a matter if time.
