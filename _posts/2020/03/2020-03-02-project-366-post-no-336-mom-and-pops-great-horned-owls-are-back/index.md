What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

March 1 and mom and pops Great Horned owl team is back in their cavernous tree down in the Whitemud Ravine. This couple are a bit of celebrities and people flock to their tree to watch them snooze. Last year they raised a pair of fluffy chicks using the same nesting location. I wrote several posts about the event: [here](http://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/04/01/project-366-post-no-004-a-celebrity-couple/), [here](http://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/04/07/project-366-post-no-010-great-horned-owl-on-eggs/), [here](http://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/04/29/project-366-post-no-032-great-horned-owl-family/) and [here](http://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/05/23/project-366-post-no-056-great-horned-owl-chicks/). Assuming there female is sitting on eggs (or will be shortly) based on last year's time line we are probably not going to see any owlets until end of April or beginning of May at least. So we are in for a bit of a waiting game.
