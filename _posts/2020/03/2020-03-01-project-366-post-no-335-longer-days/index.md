What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

The number of hours of daylight is not noticeably longer than just a few weeks ago. Currently the length of time between sunrise and sunset is increasing by about 4 minutes and 13 seconds every day. By the end of the month the days will be 4 minutes and 14 minutes longer every day. The season changes are happening fast now. The changes are also evident in the behavior of the local birds with more song, starting to prep nests and more social interactions in species that normally are solitary. Breeding season is definitely coming up. It will be interesting to see how long it will take before the first returning migrant show up..., and who it will be.
