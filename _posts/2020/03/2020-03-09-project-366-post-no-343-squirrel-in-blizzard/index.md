Clearly this Red Squirrel was not being bothered by the snow blizzard the least bit. It had found a spot on top of the back rest of a park bench overlooking the Whitemud Creek. It seemed to be contemplating profound things as it was gazing out over the frozen creek as the snow fell and blew around it. Even when it ended up having snow on its face it did not seem to mind. I assume it might take a squirrel to understand a squirrel.
