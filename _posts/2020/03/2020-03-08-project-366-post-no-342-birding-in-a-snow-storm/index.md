It can be safely said that most people would agree that a snow blizzard is not the best circumstances for going birding. But if the birding is on the agenda and it just happens to snow..., sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and go for it. Birding while the snow flying sideways presents particular challenges. Some are obvious such as such as snow covered binoculars and the need to protect camera equipment. Other are perhaps not obvious, such as the camera focusing system being thrown off by blowing snow. Oh, and the minor detail that most birds are in hiding during such inclement weather is also somewhat of an inconvenience. This particular birding outing had, however, a particular goal in mind..., to check in on mom and pops Great Horned Owls, which, are pretty much stationary and this point no matter the weather conditions.
