What is Project 366? Read more [here](https://thebirdsarecalling.com/2019/03/29/project-366/).

This Hairy Woodpecker did not fancy getting its picture take. Instead of just flying away it turned its back on me. Perhaps the tree was a good source of food and it wanted to spend more time foraging there? The subtleties that differentiate hairy an Downy Woodpeckers are intriguing. I have seen enough Hairy and Downy Woodpeckers to tell that the slightly larger size of this one means it is a Hairy Woodpecker. If you can see the bill, that would be another useful clue. In hairy Woodpeckers the bill is almost as long as the length of the head (if you would "fold the bill over backwards" it would almost reach the other side of the head), while in Downy Woodpeckers the bill is substantially shorter relative the the width of the head.
