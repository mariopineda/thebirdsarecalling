Yesterday's post was about an audacious and carefree Black-backed Woodpecker. Well, today's post is about the damage he caused. The picture shows the "trail of destruction" he left behind. On our way back the woodpecker was gone but the handiwork of his activity was clearly visible. The woodpecker's strategy seems to have been to focus on peeling the bark off the pine tree and then "dig" deeper at promising locations under the bark. This seems like a pretty effective strategy for a smaller woodpecker. Larger woodpeckers, such as the Pileated Woodpecker, typically seems to focus more on digging deeper into the tree, which makes sense considering their substantially larger size.
